# Clustering Ghanas Members of Parliament by Twitter Usage
This repo contains [R Code](https://github.com/DavidQuartey/clustering_ghanas_mps_by_twitter_usage/blob/master/member_of_parliament_groups.R) and [data](https://github.com/DavidQuartey/clustering_ghanas_mps_by_twitter_usage/blob/master/mps_twitter_profile.txt) used in grouping Ghana's MPs according to how they use Twitter. The analysis can be found [here](https://medium.com/@DaveQuartey/ghanas-members-of-parliament-and-how-they-use-twitter-b5154d49d7c2), [here](https://technovagh.com/2018/08/06/guest-post-ghanas-members-of-parliament-and-how-they-use-twitter/), and [here](http://odekro.org/blog/32/ghanas-members-of-parliament-and-how-they-use-twitter).

## Technique
I used [hierarchical clustering](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/hierarchical-clustering/). This technique allows us to group MPs who share similarities in a lot of their Twitter usage.
